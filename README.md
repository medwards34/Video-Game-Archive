# Video-Game-Archive
This database aims to create a list of existing video games since its origin. While this is not an exhaustive list, the goal is to provide many titles from mainstream consoles, some PC and mobile with an array of genre and series. 

If you are interested in contributing to this archive please follow the instructions below.

Before getting started, you must first have Git installed. if you do not have Git installed [Install it here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

The archive is broken down into several sections starting with the title of the video game. What information this list needs from each title includes:

   -Developer of the game

   -Publisher of the game

   -The Series the game is from (if the games or characters exist in a franchise/series)

   -The release year of the game (North America date only)
   
   -The genre of the game

   -The mode of play the game has (single player, multi player, etc...).
